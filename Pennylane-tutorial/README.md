# Barren gadgets - tutorial

> By Simon Cichy

> Based on the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03099">
A perturbative gadget for delaying the onset of barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms</a>.

Using perturbative gadgets for the mitigation of cost function dependent barren 
plateaus in variational quantum algorithms.
In this repository, you'll find the tutorial in the form of a jupyter notebook
(```perturbative_gadgets_for_VQE.ipynb```)
and some additional files containing the specific methods developed 
for this purpose.
