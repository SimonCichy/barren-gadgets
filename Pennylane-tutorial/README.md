# Barren gadgets - tutorial

Using perturbative gadgets for the mitigation of cost function dependent barren 
plateaus in variational quantum algorithms.
In this repository, you'll find the tutorial in the form of a jupyter notebook
(```perturbative_gadgets_for_VQE.ipynb```)
and some additional files containing the specific methods developed 
for this purpose.
